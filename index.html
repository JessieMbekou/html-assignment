                    <p>Hi there! I'm <strong>Jessie</strong>. I am a 23 year old Cameroonian girl, passionate of tech and design.   
                        I hold a Bachelor's degree in software engineering and would like to pursue a career as a UI/UX designer.
                        Curiosity is probably one of my main characteristics, as I always strive to acquire more knowledge and experience
                        in life. I always want to understand how things work and want to come about different solutions in achieving my goals </p>
                    <p>
                        I am hardworking when it comes to things I am passionate about. I am a perfectionist and I always want things to be on point.
                        It is not always the case all the time, but I try harder to do better at every trial. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Most of the time I spend my time doing things that I love, which are not necessarily school-related. Some of these things are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Music: </strong>I sing and listen to music all the time. It relaxes me and helps me feel better whenever I am down.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dance: </strong>I love dancing and used to have a dance crew back in my country. Dancing helps me evacuate stress.</li>
                        <li><strong>Animes: </strong>Animes are my world. I've been waching animes ever since I was a child and have never stopped until now.</li>
                        <li><strong>Football: </strong>I am a soccer fan and my favorite player is Lionel Messi. I love watching football whenever I'm chanced to.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sleeping: </strong>Last but not the least, I love sleeping most of the time. I'm in love with my bed and do literaly everything in bed.</li>
                    </ul>
